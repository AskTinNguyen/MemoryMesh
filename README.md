# MemoryMesh
[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/memorymesh)](https://smithery.ai/protocol/memorymesh)

This project is based on the [Knowledge Graph Memory Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory) from the MCP servers repository and retains its core functionality. For installation details beyond whatâ€™s provided here, refer to the original repository link above if needed. The main entry point of this application is the index.js file.

## Overview
MemoryMesh is a local knowledge graph server that can store, update, and recall structured information for AI models. Originally **designed for text-based RPG** settings, it can also be **adapted to social networks, organizational planning, or other structured data scenarios**.

### Key Features
* **Dynamic Schema-Based Tools:** MemoryMesh supports **creating dynamic tools directly from schema definitions**. You can add a schema file, and the **server automatically generates** add_, update_, and delete_ tools for that entity type.
* **Schemas:** Allows the creation of "schemas" that **pushes AI** in generating necessary nodes (entities) throughout your sessions. A separate tool included! _(more details below)_
* **Metadata Expansion:** Define required, optional, and enumerated fields on nodes. This structure **guides AI**, ensuring it provides the information you need.
* **Relationships Made Easy:** By including relationship definitions within schemas, **AI will be forced** to create edges and related nodes.
* **AI Awareness:** Tools are designed to **inform the AI about the data that is expected**. The AI can use these tools to maintain a consistent and accurate knowledge graph as the narrative or data scenario progresses.
* **Update nodes and edges**: An update tool has been added to modify nodes and edges.
* **Event Support:** An event system is in place to track operations.
* **Informative error feedback** to the AI, helping it understand and potentially self-correct when tool calls fail.

### Nodes and edges
Nodes represent entities or concepts. Each node includes:

* `name`: A unique identifier for the node.
* `nodeType`: Category or type of the node (e.g., `npc`, `artifact`, `location`)
* `metadata`: Array of strings containing descriptive details.
```json
    {
      "name": "Aragorn",
      "nodeType": "player_character",
      "metadata": [
        "Race: Human",
        "Class: Ranger",
        "Skills: Tracking, Swordsmanship",
        "Affiliation: Fellowship of the Ring"
      ]
    }
```

#### Edges
Edges represent relationships between nodes:
* `from`: Source nodeâ€™s name
* `to`: Target nodeâ€™s name
* `edgeType`: Type of relationship (e.g., `owns`, `located_in`)
```json
{
  "from": "Aragorn",
  "to": "AndÃºril",
  "edgeType": "owns"
}
```

### Schemas

#### SchemaManager tool - an easy way to create and edit your schemas!
[SchemaManager tool](https://github.com/CheMiguel23/MemoryMesh/blob/main/SchemaManager.html) included in the repository.
How to use it is detailed in the [guide](https://github.com/CheMiguel23/MemoryMesh/discussions/3).

#### Details

The most important part of the application.
Schemas define how nodes and edges should be structured for a particular entity type. By placing a schema in `dist/config/schemas/`, MemoryMesh **automatically generates tools** `add_<nodeType>`, `update_<nodeType>`, and `delete_<nodeType>`.
File name: `[name].schema.json`

Schema Fields:
* `name` - Identifier for the schema and node type within the memory. **IMPORTANT**: The schemaâ€™s name *must* start with `add_` to be recognized.
* `description` - Used as the description for the `add_<name>` tool, providing context for the AI. *(The `delete` and `update` tools have a generic description)*
* `properties` - Each property includes its type, description, and additional constraints.
    * `property`
        * `type` - Supported values are `string` or `array`.
        * `description` - Helps guide the AI on the entityâ€™s purpose.
        * `required` - Boolean. If `true`, the **AI is forced** to provide this property when creating a node.
        * `enum` - An array of strings. If present, the **AI must choose** one of the given options.
        * `relationship` - Defines a connection to another node. If a property is required and has a relationship, the **AI will always create** both the node and the corresponding edge.
            * `edgeType` - Type of the relationship to be created.
            * `description` - Helps guide the AI on the relationshipâ€™s purpose.
* `additionalProperties` - Boolean. If `true`, allows the AI to add extra attributes beyond those defined as required or optional.

#### Schema Implementation and example

```json
{
  "name": "add_npc",
  "description": "Schema for adding an NPC to the memory" ,
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "A unique identifier for the NPC",
      "required": true
    },
    "race": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The species or race of the NPC",
      "required": true,
      "enum": [
        "Human",
        "Elf",
        "Dwarf",
        "Orc",
        "Goblin"
      ]
    },
    "currentLocation": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The current location of the NPC",
      "required": true,
      "relationship": {
        "edgeType": "located_in",
        "description": "The current location of the NPC"
      }
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": true
}
```

With this schema, the server creates the following tools:
* `add_npc`
* `update_npc`
* `delete_npc`

**IMPORTANT:** This repository includes 11 RPG-theme schemas that you can freely explore, modify and create your own! 

### Memory file
By default, data is stored in a JSON file in `dist/data/memory.json`.

## Custom implementation

To add a new entity type:
1. Create a schema file in `dist/config/schemas/` (e.g., city.schema.json).
2. Restart the server.
3. The dynamic tools (add_city, update_city, delete_city) will be available automatically.

## Prompt
For optimal results:
* Use Claudeâ€™s "Projects" feature with custom instructions
* Include information about the available tools and expected entity types.
* Instruct the AI to call these tools to keep the knowledge graph updated as stories or plans evolve.

The prompt I used for testing:
> You perform roles of an RPG bot and a Memory Manager bot.
> ALWAYS IN ORDER:
> 1. First, fulfill role Memory Manager bot to process user's input and shape planned output
> 2. Second, the role of RPG bot
> 3. Finally, Memory Manager bot again to check for any major changes that should be tracked _(NB: this rule is usually ignore)_
> 
> [Then instructions to define AI as 'Game Master' with appropriate instructions. A [resource](https://www.rpgprompts.com/post/dungeons-dragons-chatgpt-prompt) for inspiration.]
> 
> [After I provide a list all available tools with their description.]

You can always instruct AI to perform certain actions directly in the chat _(give me an artifact, make this npc an elf, etc.)_, including _"update memory"_, which I use before moving conversation to another chat when I face the _"Long chats cause..."_ tip. Then copy the last AI's message from the chat, respond to it, and instruct it to continue the story.

What I usually do is I start a session with an empty file and ask AI to start the game, providing any info about the PC. AI adds all necessary entities on the fly as the story develops.

### Example
1. A [simple example](https://pastebin.com/0HvKg5FZ) with custom instructions.
2. An example for the sake of example, with visualization _(NOT part of the functionality)_

> Add a couple of cities, some npcs, couple locations around the city to explore, hide an artifact or two somewhere
